# DevExtreme (Persian Support)

This project has minimal modifications to original DevExtreme version with following features:

- Persian Date Picker
- Localized Persian Messages

For use you must only set locale to 'fa-IR' or set calendar using Intl to persian:

```js
import { locale } from "devextreme/localization";

// ...

function App() {

    // ...

    locale("fa-IR");
    // or
    locale("fa-IR-u-ca-persian-nu-latn");
    // or
    locale("en-US-u-ca-persian-nu-latn");

    // ...
}

```
